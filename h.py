## generate word from a list of words
## track location of each letter
## ask user to input a letter
## make a varibale that gives user 7 tries
## create a while loop to constantly ask user for input until 7 tries are over or user gets the word right
## if letter guessed is in that word, print location of the letter
## else, remove 1 from variable tries
## always check to make sure tries > 0
## if variable tries is 0, break the while loop
## else, continue the game
